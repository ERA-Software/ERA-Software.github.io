# ERA Software – Website

This repository contains the source code for the ERA Software organization website:

**https://era-software.github.io/**

The site provides open-source tools for uncertainty quantification and decision-making in engineering risk analysis. It is built with **MkDocs** (Material theme) and deployed via **GitHub Pages** from the `main` branch (`/docs` folder).

---

## Structure

```
mkdocs.yml        # MkDocs configuration
requirements.txt  # Python dependencies (pinned)
src_docs/         # Markdown source files (edit these)
docs/             # Generated static site (served by GitHub Pages)
```

- Edit content in `src_docs/`
- Run `mkdocs build --clean`
- Commit both `src_docs/` and the generated `docs/`
- Push to `main` to deploy

---

## Local development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

---

## Build for deployment

```bash
mkdocs build --clean
git add src_docs docs
git commit -m "Update website"
git push
```

---

## Notes

- Do not edit files inside `docs/` manually — they are generated by MkDocs.
- MkDocs is pinned to `<2` for compatibility with the Material theme.
- Keep the website minimal, clear, and focused on ERA-Software tools.
